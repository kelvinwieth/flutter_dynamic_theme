# flutter_dynamic_theme

This project is a POC to test dynamic theme changing on Flutter apps using Inherited Widgets.

To run the app, clone this repo and run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies, then `flutter run` to start.

The only supported platform is Linux, but you can add new ones by running `flutter create . --platforms=<desired-platform>`, for example `flutter create . --platforms=macos`.
